        <p>The Ontario foster care system is quite different from most other provinces. The government, <a href="http://www.children.gov.on.ca/" target="_blank">Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS)</a>, sets the rules for how foster care is to be carried out. MCYS does not, however, have the role of helping people in becoming a foster parent in Ontario.
        <br>This task is left to agencies which have a license to provide foster care such as Annie's Havens or a local Children's Aid Society. The MCYS visits each agency every year to make sure that we are following the rules.</p>
        <br><p>The difference between what a foster care agency does and what a Children's Aid Society is responsible for can be a bit confusing. We both open and maintain foster homes but the Children's Aid Society has the added responsibility of investigating complaints, handling adoptions and more.</p>
        <br><p>Below is an deeper look at the roles and responsbilities for the MCYS, Children's Aid and Annie's Havens.</p>

            <p>Like many Ministries in the Ontario Government, the Ministry of Children and Youth Services has many jobs to do. For our context, the MCYS makes sure that all foster care licensees (Annie's Havens or Children's Aid) follow a law called the Child, Youth and Family Services Act.</p>

                        <p>In order to open foster homes and accept foster children, agencies need to qualify and have a valid license - think licensed daycare. There are many requirements which must be followed which makes sure that we respect the child in care as an individual, and most importantly, that we have safe and supportive homes.</p>
                        <br><p>This license needs to be renewed annually. If an agency does not follow the rules completely they will get a warning called a "Term and Condition". These warnings are serious and an agency could lose their license if not corrected. For this reason, nost agencies are very strict when it comes to getting paperwork filled out correctly and on time.</p>

                        <p>Ontario follows the <a href="https://www.unicef.ca/en/policy-advocacy-for-children/about-the-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child" target="_blank">United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>.

                        <p>It's generally accepted that there are three levels of care:</p>

            <span class="card-title">Children's Aid</span>
            <p>There a more than 40 Children's Aid Societies in Ontario. They are typically responsible for child welfare in the region they reside (i.e. Durham CAS is responsible for the Durham Region). They are non-profit private organizations who receive direct funding from the MCYS and additional funds through their charity.</p>
            <br><p>When they receive a complaint from the community (i.e. school, neighbour, family member) about the welfare of a child they assess if an investigation is required. If they choose to investigate the outcome could lead to ongoing work with the family to improve the situation or, if there is a safety concern, they may remove the child(ren) from the home.</p>
            <br><p>Children's Aid has their own foster homes and will see if they have an appropriate space for incoming children. If there is no appropriate option, the CAS will refer the child to other agencies such as Annie's Havens. This <em>usually</em> means that the lowest needs children go to CAS foster homes.</p>

                        <p>In Ontario, the responsibility for child welfare investigations lay with the Children's Aid Societies. As stated above, investigations don't necessarily lead to children being removed from their home.</p>
                        <br><p>Investigations can also happen to foster homes. Sometimes, if an allegation is serious, all foster children may be temporarily placed in other homes until the investigation is complete.</p>
                        <p>While investigations are very stressful and the allegations may be false, it is important for Children's Aid to have this authority to keep children safe.</p>

                        <p>Most of the time a Children's Aid will have guardianship of the child in care. This is not always the case but it is most often. Guardianship means that the CAS has to give their support for school placement, medical direction and any other situation where consent is needed and the child is unable to give consent on their own.</p>
                        <br><p>Since the CAS has guardianship, foster parents understand that while they are the primary caregiver, their authority on certain matters is limited.</p>

                        <p>There are private adoption agencies in Ontario. All public adoptions are carried out by the Children's Aid Societies. This means that all foster children who are elligible for adoption have their adoption handled by their CAS.</p>

Becoming a foster parent in Ontario means going through the process of a Home Study, background checks and training. All of this is provided at no cost to the potential foster home.</p>
                        <br><p>Once a foster home is approved, they will begin to receive referral packages from Annie's Havens. These referral packages contain as much information as possible about the child so that the home can make an informed decision to accept the child.</p>
                        <br><p>Our homes also receive funding for 24-days of relief. Relief means the children go to another home for a weekend or we provide a caregiver to come to the foster home while the foster parent(s) go away for rest and relaxation.</p>
