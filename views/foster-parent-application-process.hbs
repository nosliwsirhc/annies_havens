        <p class="process-lead"><strong>It can seem daunting to start the foster parent application process.</strong></p>
        <p>Therefore, look at it as a small series of steps that get you qualified and prepared to accept children into your home. It will feel less overwhelming because you mentally break down the process.</p>
        <p>Being better prepared for the challenges facing children coming into care is essential to the application process and orientation training. Most of all, a safe home is also a major point of focus while we move along with the application. When we conduct background checks, the goal is to eliminate (as best as possible) individuals who have a prior history of child protection concerns or criminality.</p>
