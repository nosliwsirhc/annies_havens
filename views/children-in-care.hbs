        <h2 id="before-care">Before Foster Care: The Challenges Children Face</h2>
        <p>Children and youth are not placed in foster care without reason. Many of the young people we serve have lived through difficult circumstances, which may include:</p>
        <ul class="collection">
          <li class="collection-item list"><i class="material-icons yellow-text text-darken-2">report_problem</i><span><strong>Exposure to neglect or abuse</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Basic needs may not have been met consistently or safely.</span></li>
          <li class="collection-item list"><i class="material-icons red-text text-darken-2">luggage</i><span><strong>Unstable living situations</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Frequent moves, unsafe housing, or homelessness can create fear and uncertainty.</span></li>
          <li class="collection-item list"><i class="material-icons deep-orange-text text-darken-2">psychology</i><span><strong>Parental struggles</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Challenges such as addiction, mental health concerns, or domestic violence disrupt healthy development.</span></li>
          <li class="collection-item list"><i class="material-icons blue-text text-darken-2">assignment_late</i><span><strong>Educational disruptions</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Missed school and limited support can lead to learning gaps and frustration.</span></li>
          <li class="collection-item list"><i class="material-icons pink-text text-darken-2">heart_broken</i><span><strong>Loss and trauma</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Separation from family, siblings, community, or culture can be deeply painful.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">These experiences often leave children feeling uncertain, mistrustful, or fearful about the future. Early, compassionate support helps rebuild safety and trust.</p>

        <p>Even when a foster home is caring and safe, the transition can be stressful. Children and youth may experience:</p>
        <ul class="collection">
