        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>We have a total commitment to quality and excellence in all that we do. Annie’s Havens will provide a positive growth environment to all children placed in our care.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this we need to consider careful placement of the child, as well as exceptional support and specialized training to our foster parents and staff.</p>

        <div class="card-content">
            <p>All Ontario foster children come into care with some degree of trauma and unique considerations. Part of our training program is devoted to covering some of the expected behaviours and how to cope with those is a supportive lens.</p>
            <br><p>That being said, children in our mainstream program present with far fewer of these unique needs and a low degree of trauma-related behaviours. Mainstream children represent a lower percentage of our foster child group as these children tend to be placed with Children's Aid foster homes, though this is not always the case.</p>
            <br><p>Many of the people looking to become foster parents in Ontario would do well in this category. With in-service training and some time spent caring for special needs and traumatized kids, these parents can <strong>upgrade</strong> their skillset to work with more complex children. The per diem - amount per day, per child given to the foster parent(s) - is $70 - $75 (i.e. two (2) children @ $70/day multiplied by a thirty (30) day month = $4200 - or $51,100 per year).</p>

            <p>Annie’s Havens began as a foster care agency specifically helping children with developmental and medical special needs. We have branched out in recent years to provide care for a broader spectrum of children.</p>
            <br><p>Special needs children and youth still remain at the core of why we are involved in the child welfare sector. Our special needs foster homes have a phenomenal reputation. We continue to receive several referrals each week for children with developmental/physical challenges and medical issues.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is difficult to find homes for special needs children. These children need committed caregivers with experience. We have a great training program but experience is key to understanding the issues involved.
            <br><p>Helpful backgrounds include nursing, personal support work or caring for a close family member. Annie’s Havens also provides Personal Support Workers (PSW) for kids with higher care needs. Support hours range from 15 to 60 hours per month. The per diem is $80 - $90 depending on experience, education and wheelchair accessibility (i.e. two (2) children @ $80/day multiplied by a thirty (30) day month = $4800 - or $58,400 per year).</p>

                        <p>Often it's asked, "Do I need to have knowledge in all special needs?". No. It is not expected that parents be a “Swiss army knife” catering to all needs. Most referrals are for children
                            with autism and mobility issues. A therapeutic background in autism is an asset for kids with ASD. Wheelchair
                            accessible homes are required for kids with mobility issues. All other issues are discussed during recruitment
                            and in the home study. Kids who are medically fragile or palliative are the most difficult. They require
                            a massive commitment as they are frequently hospitalized.</p>

                            An 8-year old needs diaper changes and is unable to feed herself would have a PSW, for example. Another example,
                            a 6-year old is developmentally delayed and needs help picking out his clothes and getting ready for school
                            would not have a PSW. There are other factors as well which are not covered in these examples.</p>
